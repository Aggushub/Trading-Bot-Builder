## 📅 Day 1 — Aug 14

**Highlights:**
Today marks the *official* start of this project’s life story! 🚀

* Decided that the project will be built using **Bubble** — the no-code wonder.
* Currently diving into learning Bubble’s quirks and superpowers 🧠💡
* Started sketching out models and drafting plans for the project (because even great ideas need a blueprint 📝).

> The excitement is real, and so is my schedule table.

Coming soon........

If you want, I can make each log entry **automatically styled** with a heading, highlights, and maybe even a "Mood of the Day" section to keep it fun but still professional. Would you like me to structure it that way from now on?
